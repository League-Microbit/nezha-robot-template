# nezha-robot-template — Makefile
#
# Thin wrapper over the npm scripts in package.json, which in turn call
# the shell scripts in scripts/. `make X` and `npm run X` do the same thing;
# scripts/ holds the single implementation of each.
#
# Everything runs inside the repo — no global state touched.

# Overridable: make deploy MICROBIT=/Volumes/OTHER, make code PORT=8080
# MICROBIT has no default here: unset, scripts/deploy.sh finds the drive by its
# label, which is what makes `make deploy` work on Linux as well as macOS.
